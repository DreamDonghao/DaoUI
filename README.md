## Introduction

DaoUI is a cross platform C++GUI library developed in C++, 
allowing you to quickly develop desktop applications using DaoUI.

DaoUI is developed based on SDL3 and can be accelerated by hardware.
All content is drawn in batches using vertex arrays,
which has good performance when used properly. 
Therefore, it can also be used for game development.
However, as DaoUI is not a professional game engine, 
there may be higher requirements in terms of program optimization.
You can use DaoUI to create your 2D games or other visual applications.

DaoUI does not have as many components for developers to use as Qt does,
but only provides basic content such as textures, geometric shapes,
buttons, etc. Therefore, DaoUI has an extremely low learning cost,
and as long as you have experience using C++,
you can get started in a very short time.
And various commonly used components are currently under development.

You can boldly participate in the development of DaoUI,
whether you are a student without any development experience or interested in programming, 
you can use this project to increase your development experience.

You may wonder why there is still a need to write a duplicate when there are already many existing libraries.
Perhaps it's out of interest.
